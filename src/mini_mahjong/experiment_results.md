## Experiment 1:

Fixed initial hand of 22679, 100k trials per strategy

### naive strategy #1: random discard

100000 trials: win % = 73.425, avg draws = 16.90541
avg draws (wins only) = 12.220797

### naive strategy #2: discard lowest tile

100000 trials: win % = 87.027, avg draws = 9.34
avg draws (wins only) = 7.9905434

### naive strategy #3: discard highest tile

100000 trials: win % = 84.163, avg draws = 7.68687
avg draws (wins only) = 6.2416143

### naive strategy #3: discard isolated tiles first (otherwise random)

"isolated tile" = there are no tiles of the same rank, or of neighboring rank(s)

100000 trials: win % = 84.163, avg draws = 7.68687
avg draws (wins only) = 6.2416143

## Experiment 2:

Starting with the same set of N initial hands (generated randomly)

### naive strategy #1: random discard

### naive strategy #2: discard lowest tile
